This is a mini `R` package for cleaning and preprocess *YouTube* comment
data collected with the `R` packages
[tuber](https://github.com/gojiplus/tuber) or
[vosonSML](https://github.com/vosonlab/vosonSML). The package is a
collection of functions that were developed during several workshops on
collecting and analyzing *YouTube* data at [GESIS - Leibniz Institute
for the Social Sciences](https://www.gesis.org/home). The main function
of the package is
[`parse_yt_comments()`](https://gesiscss.github.io/tubecleanR/reference/parse_yt_comments.md)
which takes a dataframe containing *YouTube* comments collected with
`tuber` or `vosonSML` as input and outputs a processed dataframe in
which URLs/links, video timestamps user mentions, emoticons, and emoji
have been extracted from the comments into separate columns. In addition
to this, the function creates a column containing textual descriptions
of the emoji, and another one containing a cleaned version of the
comment in which the elements listed before as well as numbers and
punctuation have been removed.

**Please note**: The functions in this package are heavily dependent on
the structure of the data exports from `tuber` and `vosonSML`, and, by
extension, the structure of the *YouTube* API. You can find an
introduction to the *YouTube Data API* in the [*GESIS Guide on Digital
Behavioral Data* on “How to Collect Data with the YouTube Data
API”](https://www.gesis.org/fileadmin/admin/Dateikatalog/pdf/guides/13_Kohne_et_al_How_to_YouTube.pdf).

## 1) Installation

``` r
 # GitHub version
 library(remotes)
 remotes::install_github("gesiscss/tubecleanR")
```

## 2) Demo data

We have created some simulated *YouTube* comment data in the `tuber` and
`vosonSML` formats that is included in this package.

``` r
# Attaching package
library(tubecleanR)

# Checking example comments bundled with the package
View(tuberComments)
View(vosonComments)

# Parsing comments
tuber_parsed <- parse_yt_comments(tuberComments)
voson_parsed <- parse_yt_comments(vosonComments)

# Checking parsed versions of example comments
View(tuber_parsed)
View(Voson_parsed)
```

## 3) Using your own data

The
[`parse_yt_comments()`](https://gesiscss.github.io/tubecleanR/reference/parse_yt_comments.md)
function is meant to be used for *YouTube* comment data collected with
the `get_all_comments()` function from `tuber` or the `Collect()`
function from `vosonSML`. Both of those require access credentials for
the *YouTube API*. Check the documentation of those two packages for
further details.

If you want to learn more about getting access to the *YouTube* API,
collecting comment (and other) data from the API using `R`, and
processing and exploring the resulting data, you can also check out the
materials from our
[workshop](https://github.com/jobreu/youtube-workshop-gesis-2023).
